### **Overview of the Project:**

This project is a **Simple Quiz** web application designed to test the user's knowledge with a basic multiple-choice question. The key components of the project are:

1. **Question Display**: The quiz asks a simple question, such as "What is 2 + 2?", displayed at the top of the page.

2. **Answer Options**: The user is presented with three possible answers (3, 4, and 5), presented as radio buttons. The user selects one option as their answer.

3. **Submit Button**: After selecting an answer, the user clicks a "Submit" button to submit their response.

4. **Answer Evaluation**: When the user submits their answer, JavaScript checks whether the selected answer is correct (the correct answer is "4"). It evaluates the answer and calculates the score.

5. **Result Display**: After submitting the answer, the question and options are hidden, and the userâ€™s score (either 1 or 0) is displayed, indicating whether their choice was correct.
